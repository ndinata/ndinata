I'm Nico and I'm a mobile app dev who've worked primarily with React Native + TypeScript, Nextjs (Reactjs), and Flask (Python).

The repos you see here will be a mix of:
- archived uni assignments showcasing the different things I've been exposed to,
- side projects to keep my skills sharp, and
- experiments to explore interesting areas, such as static analysis of programs

I'm also currently trying to be more proficient in Rust and Swift because they're cool languages and I wanna be able to create cool things with them someday ðŸŒ±
